Welcome to the readme file for Squito.

I shall start off the project by implementing basic html elements with php to ensure that server-side functionality was focused on before hand.

Thereafter, I shall implement bootstrap, css, js, and jquery to further optimise the site. I may make use of toastr for notifications.
